SalesforceIntegration– The Complete Guide
 # MasterConnecting Salesforce with External Systems
 Integrating Salesforce with external systems is crucial for businesses to
 synchronize data,automateworkflows,andimprove efficiency. This series
 will cover everything about Salesforce Integration, from fundamental
 concepts to advanced architectures, with real-world examples.
 WhatYou'llLearn:
 Types ofIntegration
 Salesforce APIs (REST, SOAP, Bulk, Streaming,GraphQL)
 Authentication & Authorization (OAuth, Named Credentials, Connected
 Apps)
 Middleware&Event-DrivenIntegration
 Advancedintegration patterns
 Best Practices & Security Considerations
Part1:Understanding Integration in Salesforce
 Before diving into technical implementation, let’s understand what integration is and why it
 matters.
 What isIntegration?
 Integration is the process of connecting Salesforce with external applications (databases, ERPs,
 payment gateways, CRMs) to enable seamless data exchange.
 WhyDoWeNeedIntegration?
 Sync Salesforce with an external database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
 Connect Salesforce with marketing tools (e.g., HubSpot, Marketo)
 Automate order processing between Salesforce and an ERP (e.g., SAP)
 Enable real-time communication using webhooks or event-driven APIs
 TypesofIntegration in Salesforce
 1DataIntegration– Synchronize data between Salesforce and external systems. Example:
 Syncing customer details from an external database into Salesforce.
 2ProcessIntegration– Automate workflows across platforms. Example: When an order is placed in
 Salesforce, automatically create an invoice in an ERP.
 3Security Integration– Manage authentication and access control between systems. Example:
 Using Single Sign-On (SSO) to log in to Salesforce with Google credentials.

2SOAPAPI–Enterprise-GradeIntegration
 Uses XMLformat forstructured messaging
 Best for legacy systems likeSAP, Oracle, and banking applications
 Uses WSDL(WebService DefinitionLanguage)
 Example:CreatinganAccount via SOAPRequest
 <soapenv:Envelopexmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
 <soapenv:Body>
 <create xmlns="urn:partner.soap.sforce.com">
 <sObjects>
 <type>Account</type>
 <Name>Test Account</Name>
 </sObjects>
 </create>
 </soapenv:Body>
 </soapenv:Envelope>
 3BulkAPI–HandlingLargeDataVolumes
 Used for data migration and batch processing
 Processes records asynchronously
 Example:Bulk APIJSONRequest
 {
 "operation": "insert",
 "object": "Account",
 "records": [
 {"Name": "Account 1"},
 {"Name": "Account 2"}
 ]
 }
4StreamingAPI–Real-TimeUpdates
 Push-based API for real-time notifications
 Uses PushTopics & Change Data Capture (CDC)
 Example: Subscribing to Account Updates
 PushTopic pt = new PushTopic();
 pt.Name = 'AccountUpdates';
 pt.Query = 'SELECT Id, Name FROM Account';
 pt.ApiVersion = 57.0;
 pt.NotifyForOperations = 'All';
 insert pt;
 5GraphQLAPI–FetchingData Efficiently
 Fetch multiple objects in a single query
 Uses GraphQL syntax for flexible queries
 Example: Fetch Account and Contacts in One Query
 {
 "query": "query { Account(id: \"001XX000003DHPX\") { Name Contacts { Name Email } } }"
 }
Part3:Authentication &Authorization
 Tosecurely integrateSalesforce with external systems, we useOAuth 2.0 authentication
 and NamedCredentials.
 1ConnectedApps–SecureAccessforExternalApplications
 Connected Apps allow external applications to securely connect to Salesforce.
 StepstoCreateaConnected App:
 1. Go to Setup →AppManager →NewConnectedApp
 2. Enable OAuth Settings and provide a callback URL
 3. Select OAuth Scopes (permissions)
 4. Generate Client ID & Client Secret
2OAuth2.0AuthenticationMethods
 1Username-PasswordFlow–Quickbutnot secure forproduction
 2JWTFlow–Bestforserver-to-serverintegration
 3WebServerFlow–Bestforuserauthentication
 Example:OAuth2.0TokenRequest
 POST
 https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token
 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
 grant_type=authorization_code
 &client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID
 &client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
 &redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI
 &code=AUTHORIZATION_CODE
 3NamedCredentials–SecureCalloutsWithoutHardcoding
 NamedCredentials storeauthentication details for external APIs securely.
 Example:Calling External API using Named Credentials
 HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest();
 req.setEndpoint('callout:MyExternalService');
 req.setMethod('GET');
 HttpResponseres =new Http().send(req);
 System.debug(res.getBody());
Part4:Middleware&AdvancedIntegration
 Middleware likeMuleSoft, Dell Boomi,and Jitterbit helps connect complexsystems.
 UseCase: SyncSalesforce with an ERP (SAP, Oracle).
 Example: Middlewareprocesses databefore sending it to Salesforce.
 Part5:AdvancedIntegration Patterns
 1PlatformEvents&Event-DrivenArchitecture
 Used for real-time communication
 Helps decouple systems
 Example: Publishing aPlatformEvent
 MyCustomEvent
 e event =newMyCustomEvent
 EventBus.publish(event);
 2ExternalObjects&Salesforce Connect
 e(Field
 c ='Value');
 Access external databases in real-time without storing data in Salesforce.
 Uses OData fordata connectivity.
 Part6:Best Practices & Security Considerations
 UseOAuth 2.0 & NamedCredentials forauthentication
 Optimize API calls to avoid hitting limits
 ImplementRetryMechanisms& ErrorHandling
 Use Event Monitoring & Debug Logs
