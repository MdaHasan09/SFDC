Salesforce Integration Notes (Detailed & Example-driven) 
1. Remote Site Settings 
• What is it? 
A Remote Site Setting tells Salesforce which external endpoints (URLs) it is allowed to 
call out to. Without it, Salesforce blocks HTTP callouts for security reasons. 
• How to use? 
If you want Salesforce to call a REST API at https://api.external-system.com, you must 
f
 irst add it to Setup → Remote Site Settings. 
• Example: 
o Remote Site Name: External_API 
o Remote Site URL: https://api.external-system.com 
Now you can safely make an Http.send() call to this endpoint from Apex. 
2. SOAP API Integration 
• What is SOAP API? 
SOAP uses WSDL (Web Services Description Language) files provided by the external 
system. WSDL acts like a manual, defining methods, inputs, and outputs. 
• Steps to integrate: 
1. Get the WSDL from the external system. 
2. Upload it into Salesforce (Setup → Apex Classes → Generate from WSDL). 
3. Salesforce automatically creates an Apex class for SOAP callouts. 
4. Add the SOAP endpoint URL to Remote Site Settings. 
5. Call the generated Apex method from your code. 
• Example: 
MySOAPService.MyPort binding = new MySOAPService.MyPort(); 
binding.endpoint_x = 'https://external.com/service'; // also in Remote Site 
String result = binding.getCustomerDetails('12345'); 
3. Salesforce Standard APIs (Out-of-the-box) 
Salesforce provides standard REST and SOAP APIs to perform CRUD/DML operations on all 
objects. 
• Examples: 
o REST API: 
GET /services/data/v60.0/sobjects/Account/001XXXXXXXXXXXX 
o SOAP API: 
Using Partner/Enterprise WSDL. 
• Documentation: 
Working with Records (REST API) 
4. Connected Apps (Inbound Integration) 
• Why needed? 
When an external system needs to call Salesforce (Inbound), we must create a 
Connected App. 
• What it provides: 
o Client ID 
o Client Secret 
• Authentication: 
o Username + Password + Security Token 
o Security Token: Can be reset from My Settings → Reset Security Token 
(received via email). 
• Special Setting: 
To allow Username-Password authentication, enable: 
Setup → Security → OAuth and OpenID Connect Settings → Allow OAuth Username
Password Flows 
5. Composite REST API 
• What is it? 
Allows performing multiple operations in one request (reduces API calls). 
• Example Use Case: 
Insert one Account and multiple Contacts in one go. 
• How it works: 
o Endpoint: /services/data/v60.0/composite 
o Request Body contains sub-requests for Account + Contacts. 
6. Custom Apex REST API 
• Why needed? 
If validation, custom logic, or calculations are required before saving/updating data, 
use a Custom Apex REST API. 
• How to create? 
@RestResource(urlMapping='/MyCustomAPI/*') 
global with sharing class MyRestAPI { 
@HttpPost 
global static String createAccount(String name) { 
Account acc = new Account(Name=name); 
insert acc; 
return acc.Id; 
} 
@HttpGet 
global static Account getAccount() { 
return [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account LIMIT 1]; 
} 
} 
• Key Annotations: 
o @HttpGet → GET request 
o @HttpPost → POST request 
o @HttpPatch → PATCH request 
7. Partner vs Enterprise WSDL 
• Enterprise WSDL: 
o Tightly bound to your org’s schema. 
o Use when schema changes are rare. 
• Partner WSDL: 
o More flexible, works across multiple orgs. 
o Use when schema changes are frequent. 
8. Custom SOAP Webservice (Inbound) 
• You can expose an Apex class as a SOAP Webservice. 
• This makes your class downloadable as a WSDL to share with external systems. 
• Example: 
global with sharing class MySOAPService { 
webservice static String getGreeting(String name) { 
return 'Hello ' + name; 
} 
} 
9. Outbound Messages 
• What is it? 
If an event in Salesforce (e.g., Account creation) needs to notify an external system 
via SOAP, use Outbound Messages. 
• Features: 
o Reliable retry mechanism (keeps retrying until successful). 
o Configured in Workflow/Flow. 
• Example: 
On Account creation → send Name + Phone → External endpoint. 
10. External Services (OpenAPI Schema) 
• What is it? 
If an external system provides an OpenAPI JSON Schema, Salesforce can auto
generate invocable actions. 
• Steps: 
1. Get the OpenAPI schema (JSON with endpoint, method, request/response). 
2. Upload in Salesforce via Setup → External Services. 
3. Use the service in Flow or Apex. 
11. Named Credentials (Advanced Callouts) 
• Remote Site Setting vs Named Credential 
o Remote Site Setting: Only URL. 
o Named Credential: URL + Authentication (OAuth, Basic Auth, etc.). 
• Steps to Configure: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Create an Auth Provider (for OAuth2). 
Create External Credential with principal & scope. 
Create Named Credential using External Credential. 
Assign permission set to user. 
• Example (Apex): 
HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest(); 
req.setEndpoint('callout:My_Named_Credential/someAPI'); 
req.setMethod('GET'); 
Http http = new Http(); 
HttpResponse res = http.send(req); 
12. Platform Events (Broadcasting) 
• What is it? 
A way to broadcast messages to many external systems. 
Instead of making multiple REST callouts, Salesforce publishes an event. 
• Publishing Methods: 
o Flow 
o Apex 
o API 
• Example: 
When an Account is created, Salesforce publishes an event. 
o MuleSoft subscribes → processes event. 
o Another system subscribes → receives same event. 
13. Change Data Capture (CDC) 
• What is it? 
Automatically publishes events when field values change in Salesforce. 
• Use Case: 
Notify an external system when an Opportunity Stage changes. 
14. Salesforce Connect 
• What is it? 
Allows connecting to another org (or external DB) without storing data locally. 
It creates External Objects that fetch live data on demand. 
• Example: 
Connect Org A (Sales Cloud) with Org B (Service Cloud). Accounts in Org B appear in 
Org A as External Objects.
