Salesforce Flow Best Practice Solution
Please take care of these points when we are creating flow.
1.	if possible, apply a filter in the Entry condition of the flow, so that it will only hit the flow on the conditions that meet
2.	As much as possible do not use loops it will exceed the elements limit (2000 elements per transaction) 
Note:: In API version 57.0, the limit of 2000 flow elements was removed. In API version 56.0 and earlier, flows could have a maximum of 2000 flow elements.
3.	Apply exact conditions to reduce the iteration in a loop
4.	Delete the elements, variables, etc. which are not in use
5.	Do not use unnecessary elements  
6.	Please apply the proper conditions to reduce the components in the flow
7.	Use Formulas as well for conditional assignments
8.	Use fault path and send error email to a Admins or POC person
9.	Use Collection variable to perform any DML Operations In flow at once.

A flow description should indicate what the Flow requires to run, what it does functionally, and what it outputs. Example: A screenflow to map problem codes to IC worktypes and populate populate probemcode mapping object.

Limitations:

	Flow Builder doesn't support UTF-8 encoding for text in user input fields.
	Async flows can’t be called from auto lunch flows and in Sync flows there no option retrieve Record.Prior Values.
	Be aware of these limitations when using a time field type. The time field:  Isn’t supported in Flow Builder, Process Builder, and Schema Builder. Doesn't support the creation of custom index for SOQL queries. Isn’t available for standard lookup relationships in external objects.
