 Scenario:
 On a custom Order__c object, the Tracking_ID__c is stored. Users
 want to click a button that fetches live tracking info from a
 courier API and displays it in a modal (Lightning component).
 Question: How would you fetch live data from an external API
 when a button is clicked on a Salesforce record page?
 ✅
 Answer:
 This is where Apex + Lightning Component + API
 callout come together. I would create an Apex
 controller that performs the callout using the order’s
 tracking ID. The Lightning component calls this
 method when the user clicks a button.
 🔄
 Lightning Flow:
 Lead Inserted → Trigger calls future method
 Future method sends address to API
 API responds with corrected address → we update the
 Lead
 apex
 public with sharing class TrackingController {
 @AuraEnabled(cacheable=false)
 public static String getTrackingStatus(String trackingId) {
 HttpRequest req = new HttpRequest();
 req.setEndpoint('https://api.shiptrack.com/track?tracking_id=' + trackingId);
 req.setMethod('GET');
 Http http = new Http();
 HttpResponse res = http.send(req);
 if (res.getStatusCode() == 200) {
 Map<String, Object> result = (Map<String, Object>)
 JSON.deserializeUntyped(res.getBody());
 return String.valueOf(result.get('current_status'));
 } else {
 return 'Unable to fetch status';
 }
 }
 }

 Scenario:
 Your company uses an external HRMS system that exposes
 employee data via OAuth 2.0. Your task is to integrate it with
 Salesforce to fetch employee records once daily.
 Question: How would you implement OAuth 2.0 flow in Salesforce
 to call a protected external API?
 ✅
 Answer:
 use Named Credentials with OAuth 2.0 — this is the
 most secure and Salesforce-recommended
 approach. Once the admin completes the OAuth
 handshake, the access token is managed by
 Salesforce.
 🔑
 Setup Steps:
 1.Create Auth Provider in Salesforce with client ID, secret,
 and callback URL
 2.Create Named Credential linked to the Auth Provider
 3.Use that Named Credential in your code

 Scenario:
 Your Salesforce org needs to notify a downstream inventory
 management system whenever an Opportunity is Closed-Won,
 sending the list of products in that opportunity.
 Question: How would you design a scalable, loosely-coupled
 integration using Platform Events?
 ✅
 Answer:
 Platform Event called OpportunityWonEvent__e with
 opportunity ID and product info. The downstream system can
 subscribe to it via CometD client or Mulesoft.
 This decouples the systems — Salesforce just publishes an
 event and forgets.
 📜
 Steps:
 1.Define OpportunityWonEvent__e custom platform event
 2.Trigger on Opportunity → on Closed-Won → publish event
 3.External system subscribes to the event via streaming

        if (opp.StageName == 'Closed Won' && old.StageName != 'Closed Won') {
            String productList = ''; 
            for (OpportunityLineItem oli : [SELECT Product2.Name FROM OpportunityLineItem
 WHERE OpportunityId = :opp.Id]) {
                productList += oli.Product2.Name + '; ';
            }
            OpportunityWonEvent__e evt = new OpportunityWonEvent__e(
                OpportunityId__c = opp.Id,
                ProductList__c = productList
            );
            eventsToPublish.add(evt);

 Scenario:
 After the warehouse updates an external system that an
 order has shipped, Salesforce should receive this information
 and update the Fulfillment_Status__c field on Order__c.
 Question: How would you leverage Platform Events to receive
 order fulfillment events from an external system?
 ✅
 Answer:
 define a Platform Event—OrderFulfilledEvent__e—with relevant
 fields (OrderNumber, FulfillmentStatus).
 The external system (via middleware) publishes this event.
 Salesforce subscribes to it via an Apex trigger and updates
 the corresponding Order.
 📜
 Logic:
 1.Platform Events are great for decoupled, event-driven
 integrations. Salesforce doesn’t query external systems
 repeatedly—instead, it reacts to events raised by the
 warehouse system.

 Scenario:
 Your client must submit invoicing data to a government portal
 secured via JWT bearer token. Salesforce needs to generate the
 JWT using a private key, call the token endpoint to receive the
 access token, then send the invoice.
 Question: How would you implement a JWT‑based authentication
 flow using Apex to call a government API?
 ✅
 Answer:
 Generating and sending JWTs in Apex takes care — I build the
 header and claim, sign it using Crypto.sign, and then use that
 JWT in the token endpoint call. Once the access token is
 received, I send the invoice payload.

 Scenario:
 You want Salesforce to react when a customer record is updated
 in an external CRM (e.g., a custom app or external database). The
 external system publishes those changes as platform events via
 APIs or middleware.
 Question: How do you use Change Data Capture (CDC) or
 Platform Events to sync external changes into Salesforce in near
 real-time?
 ✅
 Answer:
 configure Salesforce to subscribe to CDC events via an
 external listener or middleware because Salesforce cannot
 directly subscribe to external systems' CDC. Instead, the
 external CRM pushes a Platform Event to Salesforce using
 CometD or API. Salesforce listens via an Apex trigger.
 🔧
 Logic Flow:
 1.External system (or middleware) publishes a
 CustomerChangeEvent__e when customer updates.
 2.Salesforce runs an Apex trigger on this event.
 3.Record is updated or created based on event payload.
